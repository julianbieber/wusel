//! Everything the run complained about, kept where a scenario can read it.
//!
//! "Did the shader compile" is the first question anyone has about a render change, and
//! the answer is otherwise on stderr mixed into a few thousand lines of engine chatter.
//! A capture cannot show it: a pass that failed to build silently draws nothing, and the
//! frame looks merely wrong rather than broken.
//!
//! Only `WARN` and `ERROR` are kept. `INFO` is where the engine narrates startup, and a
//! scenario that had to read past it would be no better off than reading the log by hand.
//!
//! A shared buffer rather than the channel-and-transfer-system that bevy's
//! `log_layers_ecs` example uses: that example wants log lines as ECS messages, and this
//! wants a pile that one exclusive system reads on demand. `Arc<Mutex<_>>` is `Send +
//! Sync`, so it can be an ordinary resource and needs no per-frame system to move
//! anything.
